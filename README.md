# TarodGuildInfo
Small mod to display basic guild info (online members and MOTD) as System message on login.

Usage: 
 - On login, guild name and MOTD will be displayed as System message and guilds with < 15 members online will display the member info (user, name, class, level and cp and zone)
 - `/guildinfo` slash command allows you to query for your guilds:
    - `/guildinfo` will display the same information as login
    - `/guildinfo #num` will display only the given guild
